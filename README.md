# Pathrise-Job-Placement-Prediction-
pathrise Job Placement Prediction This repository contains a data science project aimed at predicting job placement outcomes for Pathrise fellows. The project uses machine learning techniques to answer two main questions:  Will a fellow be placed in a job? (Classification problem)  How long does it take a fellow to get a job? (Regression problem)
# Pathrise Job Placement Prediction

This project aims to predict whether a Pathrise fellow will be placed in a job and how long it will take to secure a job. We use machine learning models to analyze and predict job placement outcomes for candidates.

## üéØ Project Objectives

1. **Will a fellow be placed in a job?**  
   A classification problem solved using models like Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest, and Decision Trees.

2. **How long does it take to be placed in a job?**  
   A regression problem that predicts job search duration based on candidate profiles.

## üìä Data Overview

This dataset includes the following features:
- `pathrise_status`: Placement status of the candidate.
- `employment_status`: Current employment status.
- `highest_level_of_education`: Education level of the candidate.
- `program_duration_days`: Duration of the job search program.
- `gender`: Gender of the candidate.
- `race`: Race/ethnicity of the candidate.
- `work_authorization_status`: Work authorization details.

## üõ† Tools and Libraries Used:
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **ML Models:** Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest, Decision Tree
- **Environment:** Google Colab, Jupyter Notebooks

## üîç Key Findings

- **Classification Model:** Random Forest performed the best in terms of accuracy for predicting placement.
- **Regression Model:** Random Forest Regressor showed the most accurate predictions for job search duration.

## üìÅ Files Included
- `pathrise_project.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook containing the full project code, analysis, and visualizations.
- `pathrise_cleaned_data.csv`: The cleaned dataset used for training and testing the models.

## ‚úÖ Project Status
The project is complete and ready for review.

## üöÄ How to Run:
1. Clone the repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Pathrise-Job-Placement-Prediction.git`
2. Open the notebook in **Google Colab** or **Jupyter Notebook**.
3. Run the cells to train models, evaluate results, and visualize outcomes.
